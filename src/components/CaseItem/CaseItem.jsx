          Many users associate money with stress and guilt. They stop using apps
          with complicated or poorly designed menus. Desire predictability. They
          want to know how their finances will be at the end of the month or
          year. Visually boring. Current tools are uninspiring or too "serious."

        <h3 className="">02 Define</h3>
        <p>
          By analyzing user research and findings, we can clearly define the
          core problems that need to be solved. Creating a user persona helps
          visualize and empathize with real users their needs, goals, pain
          points, and behaviors. This understanding allows us to make informed
          design decisions that align with user expectations and improve
          usability. Throughout the process, we can evaluate ideas by asking,
          “Would this help Anna?” ensuring that each feature remains relevant,
          purposeful, and user-centered.

        <h3 className="">03 Ideate</h3>
        <p>
          In the Ideate phase, the goal is to brainstorm and explore creative
          solutions focused on improving the user experience. With a clear
          understanding of user needs and pain points, a flow chart was
          generated to reflect the simple and intuitive app they require. Every
          idea is evaluated through the lens of our user persona to ensure that
          the final design offers both functionality and delight.

        <h3 className="">04 Design</h3>
        <p>
          Prototypes were created to bring the solution to life and visualize
          the app’s structure and flow.

          The initial designs began as pencil sketches to quickly explore layout
          ideas and user interface elements.

          These low fidelity wireframes helped establish the content hierarchy
          and navigation of the single-page application.

          The visual identity of BudgetBloom uses a soft, approachable palette
          to make financial planning feel less intimidating:

          This logo represents the emotional side of budgeting helping users not
          only control their money but also see it flourish.

          The app uses Bungee for titles and headings to give a modern, rounded
          look, and Montserrat for body text to ensure readability and
          neutrality.
